beets (1.0~b12-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Simon Chopin ]
  * New upstream release:
    - Patch libmpd-incompatibility included upstream.
  * Add myself to Uploaders:
  * Add python-musicbrainzngs in Build-Depends: since upstream dropped the embedded
    copy
  * Suggest the python-acoustid package for the chroma plugin
  * Remove the egg-info directory in the clean target of debian/rules to
    enable consecutive builds.

  [ Stefano Rivera ]
  * Refresh patches.
  * Bump copyright years, and add entries for Simon and the replaygain plugin
    from 1.0~b11.
  * Patch: integer-timestamps: Avoid test failure on filesystems with
    high-resolution file timestamps (Closes: #655732)

beets (1.0~b11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #650078)
    - No need to repack any more, upstream uses non-minified JS.
  * Drop dependency on python-musicbrainz2 (now uses the internal musicbrainz3
    library, soon to be broken out into musicbrainz-ngs).
  * Build docs, they are now included.
    - Use upstream's manpages.
    - Add doc-base entry.
  * Run tests, they are now included.
    - Use unittest2 to provide newer unittest features for python2.6.
    - Build-Depend on python-mutagen, python-munkres, and python-unidecode
    - Test under the en_US.UTF-8 locale, to work around a test expecting a
      UTF-8 locale.
  * Suggest python-rgain, for the rgain plugin.
